# NeoRift++

Just another Neonite skid!

### In acquiescence to Epic Games Inc.: <br> We are not providing any/support in-game cosmetics or a way to have them, if you want skins go buy them on the real game.

## Installation Guide

1. Install the latest version of **[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)**.
2. Download **[NeoRift++](https://github.com/Roxyboy04/neoriftv1/archive/fdev.zip)**.
3. Extract the zip.
4. Open `install.bat` and wait for it to install. (Only required on the first run!)
5. Open `run.bat`, it should say `NeoRift++ v2.0.0 is listening on port 5595!` (DON'T CLOSE THIS WHILE USING NEORIFT!)
6. Open `NeoRift++Launcher.exe` inside of the `NeoRift++` Folder
7. Launch the game **without a secret**!!!
8. On the login screen, put in `{YOURUSERNAME}@.` for the email and the password doesn't matter.
9. If everything worked correctly, you should be put into the lobby! Click `PLAY` if you wanna go inside of a game!
